                    It was long time ago, back of the times when I studied my first year University. I was in Vietnam, mainly just studies and do part-time job, like a normal student. I was lucky to get a job in one of top 10 Restaurant & Bar in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. Because of the top 10, the management and people working there have to be extremely professional, striclty rule and perfect groomed. 
                I am lucky to be a part of the bar team and one day I remember I was late because I am trying to help a poor woman. Just like a normal day, I was riding my cheap Honda scooter to work. It happened that she want to go to Railway station for taking the train to her hometown. 
                She was around 60ish I guess and struggling to find a 'motorbike taxi' (Back like 10 years ago,  car taxi is not very popular in Vietnam and also it is very expensive). I was standing at the Red traffic, she is jumping out onto the street and asking everyone for help. 
                I was also afraid because you do not when it comes to scamming or thiefing in Vietnam. Though, I felt that she is actually does not seems to be acting, as she was crying and depressing. She finnaly caught my eyes when I look at her, she is begging for help. I drived my scooter slowly and park on the street kerb, she explained to me her son get involved with traffic accident in Ben Tre (80km South West of Ho Chi Minh city),
                though she is so poor and does not have enough money to take 'taxi motorcycle' + 'train ticket', as first I thought why it is so coincident that she has nothing at the moment. But you know, I am kind of person that as if I can help, I would do as much in my capability. I knew I am going to be late as it will take around 30 minutes for me least to drive her to the Railway station and running to workplace. Still, I told her to get on my scooter and I drive her to the station.
                    Finally we got there, she manage to get on the train and I also give her like $10, it is not much but enough for her to buy some foods for her son. She was asking for my fone number and address for returning favor, I told her not to worry and she is running off to the train. I got to the workplace like 45 minutes late, without calling the boss first, I get scold. After I explained them the situation, some said why I am so stupid that worry for a stranger, some said I do a good deed. 
                <br>=> I guess the important thing here is that does not matter what is the consequence, when it is involved with Ethical decision, you will always lose something for it. The only thing you would consider is that whether your decision would be affected to other people lives, if it is not. Then following what you feel right!

                    I was born and raise in Vietnam, luckily in a very open mindset family. As my mom is Buddisht and my father is Christian, they are both sharing the life together without saying anything about others religion. Being a Asian in early 90s is a great thing to me, the harmony of both tradition and technology. Be able to learn new things at school while respect the 1000 years tradition.
                <br>=> I bet it is really hard to describe your values and indentity. Everything that created these two elements are based on your childhood, education and early in life persective.

    <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Strengths:</strong> I bet everyone when taking EDA is already make a tough decision, strong enough to choose this course rather than 2-3 years Uni, strong enough to giving up your current job to jump back into a poor student life, strong enough to believe in yourself to find a better job or chasing your coding career.
                I am the same like everyone here.
                <br>
                <strong>Limitations:</strong> I guess limitations are that you does not have much experience with these technologies, afraid and doubted in yourself.

                It was a year ago, when I still working at Sofitel Wellington. My responsibility is the Food & Beverage team, it is compuslory for you to work as a team because our team is not big enough and every member of AM & PM shift need to collaborate with each other. However, everything does not work as the way we think it should be, especially it is human with human. Staffing issues keep happened everytime, so I did try to get the team together by create a social activity and bonus for every staff managed to achieve our set target.
                <br>Strategies such like:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Team Building:</em>&nbsp;community service such like keep your local neighbor tidy and clean</li>
                    <li><em>Holiday celebration:</em>&nbsp;Christmas party, BBQ party, etc</li>
                    <li><em>Commission:</em>&nbsp;This is required the permission from your Head of Department, but it worth the value to motivate your team</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
