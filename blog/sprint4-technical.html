                <p>
                    I think everybody lived on earth at least has to experience with problem in life,
                    whether you were trying to solve it or not. Myself as everyday in life, I have to face
                    with decision and many problem. I guess it is just how you expected it to be done.

                            It was time when I try to add a hidden block which content my url to other
                            sprint for my blog page.
                            </p>

                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Solving techniques</em></td>

                            <p>
                                Obviously, I tried with Google first. Research on how to toggle a <code>div</code>. 
                                There are many ways to do it and you can find it from many online sources such like
                                W3School, StackOverflow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then I tried to explain it to my partner, she is a listener and very patient to me. Despite,
                                she has no ideas or no knowledge regards this, but she gave her point of view and ideas.
                                Sometimes, it happened in a way you never know. An advice from a non-tech friend is even simplier
                                than a techniques from StackOverflow.

                                does not have a clue about this.

                            Pseudocode method is providing useful way to describe your code in detail an step-by-step
                            approached. By writing pseudocode, I can understand what step I should be doing next eventhough
                            it is not quite clear, but I guess it is all about researching and know what you want to achieve ahead.

                    <p>
                        I always love to try something new !! Most of the time when I have to deal with all the challenges
                        in JavaScript Kata, there is always some new built-in methods of JavaScript that I need to research and 
                        quickly practice with it. I have to read the instruction and its syntax and then try to fit that method into the answer.
                        It was struggling to understand at the beginning, but once you managed to plug it in your code and start doing
                        small things happen, you soon realized how amazing it is.

                                <li>Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code line by line.</li>
                                <li>At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what you are actually doing. 
                                    The duck will sit there serenely, happy in the knowledge that it has helped you on your way.</li>

                            For me, by trying to explain a code to my friend, my partner and tell them what I was trying to do is really fun. First of all, most of them
                            does not know anything about coding. Secondly, they do not like these kind of stuff. It was fun because you know that the person you are trying
                            to explain to, they have no clue and empty knowledge about what you are doing. But still, they spent time to listen, your job is to explain them
                            very carefully, breaking down into small pieces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It just not about practicing patient but it is showing how much I understand my code. To be able to explain your code in a very detail way is 
                            extremely hard, because sometimes you would not be able to understand everything you wrote. I felt that with the more effort you I into 
                            explaining it, the deeper I can understand the problem.

                        In JavaScript Kata challenge, I spent most of the time on researching the new built-in methods and reading its error message.
                        By reading the message, you can just solve the problem step-by-step. Get the first step done, then trying to get the next one.
                        It easier to solve the whole big problem by answering each of its small issues.

                        Apart from Google, "Console.log()" is my next best mate. It is super helpful for me to examine and checking my code.
                        It helps me by breaking down my whole big messy code into a small function. Say if I have 5 logics in my code and want
                        to break it step-by-step, I can just get my first logic to run console.log('something'). And checking it with the Web Browser
                        whether it is working or not. If it works, then we simply move to the next one, else we can double check our logic.

                        Talking and asking your friends are the best way. I normally spent most of the day at school, not because I want to focus on studying but
                        also creating strong network with other people in my cohort. We may not be able to find out the answer for the problem, but least we can
