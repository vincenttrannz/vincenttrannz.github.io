            <h2>1. The difference between HTML and CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>HTML:</strong>&nbsp;It means Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</li>
                        <li><strong>CSS:</strong>&nbsp;Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It easy to understand by taking it as like how you drawing a picture. First of all, you need to know what you want to draw.
                        Then start planning how you want it to be visible on the piece of blank paper. Then, you start sketching it, create a circle and 
                        a square here and there, use your ruler to sketch a box. This is exactly what is happening within <b><i>HTML</i></b>. With <b><i>HTML</i></b>, web developer start creating
                        the structure of their web page, how they want it to be visible to other people. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After all the sketching and drawing, you can almost see how it is finally look like. However, it is just purely pencil on a piece of paper for now. And of course, you are going
                        to colour it, re-edit many more times until you actually feel happy with that. Again, it is the same with <b><i>CSS</i></b>. <b><i>CSS</i></b> is the step when a web developer
                        applies their style on their purely black and white web page.
