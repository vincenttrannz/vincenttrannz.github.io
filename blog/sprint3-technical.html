                <h2>I. The difference between HTML and CSS</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>HTML:</strong>&nbsp;It means Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</li>
                            <li><strong>CSS:</strong>&nbsp;Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            It easy to understand by taking it as like how you drawing a picture. First of all, you need to know what you want to draw.
                            Then start planning how you want it to be visible on the piece of blank paper. Then, you start sketching it, create a circle and 
                            a square here and there, use your ruler to sketch a box. This is exactly what is happening within <b><i>HTML</i></b>. With <b><i>HTML</i></b>, web developer start creating
                            the structure of their web page, how they want it to be visible to other people. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After all the sketching and drawing, you can almost see how it is finally look like. However, it is just purely pencil on a piece of paper for now. And of course, you are going
                            to colour it, re-edit many more times until you actually feel happy with that. Again, it is the same with <b><i>CSS</i></b>. <b><i>CSS</i></b> is the step when a web developer
                            applies their style on their purely black and white web page.

                <h2>II. Control Flow and Loops</h2>
                    <p>
                        The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
                        Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the 
                        (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To put 'control flow' in a simple term, you can imagine of you are waking up everyday to go to work. One simple task.
                    </p>
                    <xmp> if(time == 7) {
                            wakeUp == true;
                            } else {
                                wakeUp == false;
                            }
                    </xmp>
                    <p>
                        You can think of "Looping" in JavaScript(while) is like your simple daily life. To be put in a statement, you want to put in this way.
                        While you still awake, you will firstly take brush your teeth, go to work, get lunch, go home, eat dinner, watch movies and then go to sleep.
                        That's probably how a normal person would finish their day to day life.
                        In JavaScript, we can put this process by coding this way.
                        <xmp>var awake = []; // dailyLife is gonna be a combination of your day to day life
                            var i = ["brush teeth", "have breakfast", "go to work", "eat lunch", "go home", "eat dinner", "go to sleep"]; //tasks that you need to do everyday
                                do{
                                    awake.push(i) // This will push all the tasks you need to do everyday
                                }
                                while(awake.length <= 1) // This is state your day 1
                            => The awake[] now will equal the the array of var i.
                        </xmp>

                    <p>
                        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and XML(Extensible markup language) documents. 
                        It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DOM is a way to represent the webpage in the structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document. 
                        With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes or Elements using commands or methods provided by Document object.

                <h2>IV. Accessing Data from Arrays [ ] and Object { }</h2>
                <ol>
                    <h3><li>Acessing data from an array [ ]</li></h3>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, we need to aware that a first item in an array is declare as their position 0 (zero), not 1 (one).
                        We all start counting every object as 1, however noted that computer start counting their data nested in an array as 0.
                        By understanding that, to access the data in array. We are going to:
                        <xmp>var array = [50,60,70];
                            console.log(array[0]); // equals 50
                            console.log(array[1]); // equals 60
                            var data = array[1];  // equals 60
                        </xmp>
                    </p>
                    <h3><li>Accessing data from an Object { }</li></h3>
                    <p>There are mainly two ways to access object properties which is by dot notation "." and bracket notation [ ]</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.</li>
                        <xmp>var myObj = {
                            prop1: "val1",
                            prop2: "val2"
                          };
                          var prop1val = myObj.prop1;
                          console.log(prop1val) => val1 // value of myObj property 1
                          var prop2val = myObj.prop2; 
                          console.log(prop2val) => val2 // value of myObj property 2
                        </xmp>
                        <li>If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.
                            However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.</li>
                        <xmp>var myObj = {
                            "Space Name": "Kirk",
                            "More Space": "Spock",
                            "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
                          };
                          myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
                          myObj['More Space']; // Spock
                          myObj["NoSpace"];    // USS Enterprise
                        </xmp>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

            <section id="function">
                <h2>V. What is function and why using it?</h2>
                <div class="source">
                    <p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functions-in-javascript/">Function in JavaScript</a></p>
                </div>
                <p>A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output. 
                    Basically, a function is a set of statements that performs some tasks or does some computation and then returns the result to the user.</p>
                <p>The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again 
                    and again for different inputs, we can call that function.</p>
                <p>Like other programming languages, JavaScript also supports the use of functions. 
                    You must already have seen some commonly used functions in JavaScript like alert(), this is a built-in function in JavaScript. 
                    But JavaScript allows us to create user-defined functions also. Below is an example of how we should write a function in JS.</p>
                <xmp>function functionName() { 
                    console.log("Hello World"); // This function is only to call the "Hello World" on web browser console tab.
                    }
                    functionName() // You can now call this function whenever you need in your code to execute that function. 
                    Remember to have a bracket, as this is how you execute that function.
                </xmp>
