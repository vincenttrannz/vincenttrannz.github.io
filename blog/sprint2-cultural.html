    <ul>
        <li>My long term goal is to become a Software Developer, I love to develop the Artificial Intelligenc system and anything related to Machine learning functionality. I love the future of AI and want to see how the world adpat this Robotic age. Apart from it, I also aim to study more in Cyber Security, but haven't quite sure yet when I could do this.</li>
        <li>70% Technical and Coding, 30% Networking</li>
        <li><strong>My strength</strong> is I never want to give up one what I want to achieve / <strong>Limitation</strong> Financial resources and time</li>
        <li>As I stated, the money and time that I already invested in. I will never waste them as no one accept a lost investment.</li>
        <li>Being committed to yourself to be at EDA school everyday from 9am - 7pm, I reckon I will have enough time to ask for help from other fellow students, my facilitator, my mentor and my friends</li>
        <li>To recognized when people need help, I knew there is always someone does not how to seek for help.</li>
        <li>Luckily, I do not have much other commitment at the moment. The only person I would care is my partner at the moment, I lived too far away from my parents. The 90% commitment I have to ensure is myself. The faster I can get a job, the faster I can support my family and building my own family in the futre. </li>
